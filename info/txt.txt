1- A user accesses a web application by entering a URL in their browser.
2- The web browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
3- The web server receives the request, determines whether it's for static or dynamic content.

    1-For static content (e.g., an HTML file), the web server may directly serve the file from its file system.
    2-For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to the application server.
4- The application server executes the backend code, processes the request (e.g., reads from or writes to a database), and generates a dynamic response.
5- The application server sends the dynamic response back to the web server.
6- The web server, now possessing the dynamic response, sends it back to the user's browser.
7- The browser receives the response and renders the content for the user.
