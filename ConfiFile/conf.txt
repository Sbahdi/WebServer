Parsing class.

Have a constructor that takes as a parameter a path to the configuration file.
There is no default constructor!!!

so to call the Parsing class you should have a path to a configuration file to use it.

Prototypes:

Parsing parsing(std::string filePath);
-------------------------------------------------------------
std::string Parsing::readBlock(void);
